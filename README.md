Day Planner is a repository where I've created a simple calendar application that allows the use to save events for each hour of the day. Moment.js, a third-party API, was used to dynamically update the date and time.

[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com//) was used to set the time. 

A live link to my [Day Planner](https://nikolaslenning.github.io/day-planner/) is hosted on Github pages.

This application was authored by [Nikolas Lenning](https://github.com/nikolaslenning).
